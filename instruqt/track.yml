title: "From Commit to Culprit: An Observability Mystery"
teaser: Deploy bad code, detect anomalies with SLOs, investigate with APM, and watch automated remediation in action
description: |-
  A hands-on investigation workshop where you'll use Elastic Observability to trace a production incident from alert to root cause.

  You are Alex Chen, an on-call SRE at NovaMart, a growing e-commerce company. It's Friday afternoon and a recent deployment has just gone wrong. Use Elastic APM, distributed tracing, log correlation, and Agent Builder to find the culprit, watch automated remediation kick in, and prevent future incidents.

  **What you'll learn:**
  - Navigate Elastic APM and understand service dependencies
  - Establish baselines and monitor SLOs
  - Detect anomalies with SLO burn rate alerts
  - Investigate using trace-to-log correlation
  - Observe automated remediation via Elastic Workflows
  - Use Agent Builder for post-incident analysis

  **Prerequisites:**
  - Basic understanding of microservices
  - Familiarity with REST APIs
  - Some experience with logs and monitoring (any tool)

  **Duration:** ~90 minutes

          # Welcome to NovaMart!

          You are Alex Chen, an on-call SRE at NovaMart, a growing e-commerce company.

          Before you start your weekend on-call shift, let's make sure everything looks healthy.

          As your manager Sam Patel always says: "You cannot detect anomalies if you do not know what normal looks like."

          # A Deployment Arrives

          Jordan Rivera from the Order Service team has just deployed version 1.1 with "performance optimizations."

          Everything looked good in QA...

          Your phone is about to buzz.

          # Time to Investigate

          The alert is firing. Latency is through the roof.

          Sam Patel asks: "What's happening? Can you get this resolved before the weekend rush?"

          Time to put your investigation skills to work.

          The rollback is complete. Latency is back to normal.

          Jordan messages you: "Hey Alex, sorry about that. Can you help me understand what went wrong?"

          This is the part of the job you actually enjoy: turning incidents into lessons.
